        <p className="tighten-width">Hello, I&apos;m <strong>Andrew Biron</strong>, a Multi-Media Designer and Developer. As a graduate from Carleton University with a Bachelor of Information Technology in Interactive Multimedia and Design, bringing ideas to life, simplifying and automating certain processes are things I enjoy accomplishing.  
                     Enrolling in Carleton University&apos;s Full Stack Web Development program demonstrates my willingness to learn new things and strive to continuously improve my knowledge.
                    When I do peel away from my desk, I&apos;ll most likely be caught watching/playing sports, or finding ways to be in nature.</p>
